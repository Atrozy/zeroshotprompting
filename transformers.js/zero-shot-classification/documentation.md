# **Project Documentation: Zero-Shot Text Classification Web Application**

## **Overview**

This project is a web application that performs zero-shot text classification using a transformer model running entirely in the browser. It leverages the `@xenova/transformers` library to run transformer models without the need for a server or backend. The application allows users to input text and categorize it into predefined labels based on the model's predictions.

## **Features**

- **Zero-Shot Text Classification**: Classify text into user-defined categories without additional training.
- **Client-Side Processing**: All computations are done locally in the browser; no server is required.
- **Performance Metrics**: Display the time taken for each classification in milliseconds.
- **Customizable Categories**: Predefined categories can be modified to suit different use cases.



## **Getting Started**


### **Installation**


## Installation

To set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Atrozy/zeroshotprompting.git


2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd zeroshotprompting/transformers.js/zero-shot-classification
   npm install
   npm run dev


```
```
# Usage
## Access the Application
- Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173/.

## Input Text
- Enter the text you want to classify in the textarea provided.
- You can input multiple pieces of text, separated by new lines.

## Categorize Text
- Click the Categorize button to start the classification process.
- The model will load (if not already loaded) and process the input text.

## View Results
- The text will be categorized under the relevant sections based on the model's predictions.
- For each piece of text, you will see:
  - The classification probabilities for each category .
  - The time taken to classify the text in milliseconds.

## Clear Results
- Click the Clear button to reset the classifications and input new text.

## Key Files:
- **worker.ts**: Web Worker script that loads the model and performs text classification.
- **index.html**: The HTML template for the application.
- **App.tsx** and **index.tsx**: Stylesheets for the application.

# Technical Details
## Zero-Shot Classification Model
- **Model Used**: Xenova/mobilebert-uncased-mnli
- **Library**: @xenova/transformers
- **Quantization**: Enabled for reduced model size and faster inference.

## Web Workers
- **Implementation**: The worker.ts file sets up a worker that loads the model and performs classification .

## Client-Side Inference
- **Model Loading**: The model is downloaded and cached in the browser upon first use.
- **Advantages**:
  - **Privacy**: No data is sent to a server; all processing is local.
  - **Responsiveness**: Eliminates network latency for inference after the model is loaded.

];
```

### Adjusting the Threshold
```
const threshold = 0.2; // Set a threshold for classification
```
- **Modification**: Adjust the value between 0 and 1 as needed.

### Styling
- **Inline Styles**: You can also adjust styles directly in the TSX elements if preferred.

## Performance Optimization
### Model Quantization
- **Enabled by Default**: The model is loaded with quantization to improve performance.

## Hardware Considerations
- **CPU Performance**: Faster CPUs will reduce classification time.
- **Browser Choice**: Modern browsers with efficient TypeScript engines (e.g., Chrome, Edge) offer better performance.
- **Memory (RAM)**: Adequate RAM ensures smooth operation without swapping to disk.

## Batch Processing
- **Current Implementation**: Texts are processed individually in a loop.
- **Potential Improvement**: Modify worker.ts to perform batch inference if supported by the model.

## Known Issues
- **Initial Loading Time**: The first-time model loading can be slow due to downloading and initializing the model.
- **Memory Usage**: Loading transformer models can be memory-intensive.
- **Browser Compatibility**: Ensure you use a browser that supports Web Workers and modern TypeScript features.
